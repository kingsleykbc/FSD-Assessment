# UWP Full Stack Technical Assessment

This assessment is an opportunity for us to see how you approach a task and also how you execute it. In short, this task is to consume the response from a GraphQL request to the products endpoint, then generate and display at least 3 product cards from this information. Product cards should contain at a minimum:
* An image
* A title
* A price
* Product tags

Since you have applied for a full stack position, you will need to create the request yourself and add the click handler to the fetch button. Please note, our example uses Shopify's `2020-07` GraphQL API version, you may either upgrade to a newer version or use historic documentation.

You should aim to get your submission as close to the wireframe here (https://www.figma.com/file/9xx26qOGZbALmxIwbo9zWz/Dev-Task?node-id=1%3A9) but any additional flair is up to you.

We are evaluating:
* The readability of your code
* How you utilize git 
* How maintainable/conventional your code is
* How closely your submission follows the brief above
* How closesly your submission follows the provided Figma design
* The responsiveness of your solution
* Your usage of the fetch API and asynchronous JS

We are NOT looking for the fastest/shortest solution. We recommend using VS Code for this assessment. The `Live Sass Compiler` extension will allow you to work in sass in realtime, and the `Live Server` extension will give you a realtime preview of your work.

To get started you should fork off this repo. Once your work is complete, update the main branch on your fork and send it back to us.
